# BioReport Project Context

- Stack: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- Routing: `react-router-dom` with guarded routes.
- Data fetching and caching: TanStack Query.
- Forms and validation: `react-hook-form` + `zod` + `zodResolver`.
- i18n: `react-i18next` and translation keys via `t(...)`.

## Architecture Boundaries

- Use `src/api/client.ts` as the single HTTP client.
- Keep HTTP calls in `src/api/services/*`.
- UI/pages/components call service methods, not raw `fetch`.
- API payload/response types must come from `src/types/api.ts`.
- Reuse existing UI primitives from `src/components/ui/*` before creating new ones.

## Imports and Paths

- Prefer alias imports via `@/...` where configured.
- Keep page-level logic in `src/pages/*`.
- Keep shared/reusable logic in `src/components/*`, `src/hooks/*`, or `src/lib/*`.
