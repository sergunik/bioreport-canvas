# Forms and Validation

- Build forms with `react-hook-form` and `zodResolver`.
- Define a dedicated Zod schema per form.
- Keep validation messages and UI behavior aligned with backend contract.
- Wire field-level backend validation errors back into form fields.

## UI Conventions

- Use project form UI components (`Input`, `Label`, `Button`, etc.).
- Mark invalid fields with `aria-invalid`.
- Render field errors with shared component patterns already used in codebase.
