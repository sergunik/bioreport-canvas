# Command Execution Contract

- Never run project commands directly on the host.
- Always run commands via:

```sh
docker-compose exec app <command>
```

## Required Examples

- Install:
```sh
docker-compose exec app bun install
```
- Build:
```sh
docker-compose exec app bun run build
```
- Lint:
```sh
docker-compose exec app bun run lint
```
- Test:
```sh
docker-compose exec app bun run test
```

## Verification Rule

- After non-trivial code changes, run build, lint, and tests in the container.
